Functional Connectivity Alignment

This repository contains source code, examples and documentation relating
to alignment of fMRI signals based on their intra and inter subject
pair wise correlations.

We're currently cleaning up the code and providing some useful documentation
so that it's ready for public consumption.

For more information, see the documentation in :file:`doc`.
