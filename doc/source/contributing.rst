Code Style
==========

MATLAB
------

The Mathworks does give any directions on code style as far as I'm aware.
Worse yet, their own code base seems to be a mishmash of lowercase,
under_scores, CamelCase and mixedCase.

Therefore, in this project we use the style guide directions from NumPy:
https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/HOWTO_DOCUMENT.rst.txt

In particular, make sure you follow the NumPy docstring comment style,
so that the autodoc tools can generate our API automatically.
